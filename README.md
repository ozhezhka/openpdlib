OpenPDLib project â€’ Open Public Domain Library of [Karelian Research Centre of RAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_Research_Centre_of_RAS).

"Public domain" is the most pleasant and convenient license status of books for readers. This status allows you to read books, distribute text, change text, print and sell books even without reference to the author. New online [Open Public Domain Library](http://openpdlib.krc.karelia.ru/en) of Karelian Research Centre of RAS collects such scientific books (mainly in Russian).
