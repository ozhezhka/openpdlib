OpenPDLib project â€’ Open Public Domain Library of [Karelian Research Centre of RAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_Research_Centre_of_RAS).

"Public domain" is the most pleasant and convenient license status of books for readers. This status allows you to read books, distribute text, change text, print and sell books even without reference to the author. New online [Open Public Domain Library](http://openpdlib.krc.karelia.ru/en) of Karelian Research Centre of RAS collects such scientific books (mainly in Russian).

The librarians select rare books from the collections of the Scientific Library of the Karelian Research Centre of RAS. They check which books are in the public domain, then scan and store the file of the book in the online library. Scientific works in the public domain, scattered on the Internet, will be added to the OpenPDLib site also.
